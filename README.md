## WebSocket Subscription with Postman

You can also test the WebSocket functionality using Postman. Hereâ€™s how:

### 1\. Connect to WebSocket

1.  Open Postman and select the **WebSocket Request**.
2.  Connect to the WebSocket using the URL:

    ```
    
    ws://localhost:6001/app/my-app-key?protocol=7&client=js&version=4.3.1&flash=false
            
    ```

3.  Replace `my-app-key` with the key you've set in the `.env` file.

### 2\. Subscribe to a Channel

Once connected, you can subscribe to a specific channel by sending the following JSON:

```

{
  "event": "pusher:subscribe",
  "data": {
    "auth": "",
    "channel": "notifications.alert"
  }
}
```

### 3\. Test Notification Sending

After subscribing, use the **Send Notification** API endpoint to trigger a notification. The notification should be received in real-time in the Postman WebSocket client.




## Listening for WS event

Using wscat for Testing WebSocket Connections
You can use wscat, a WebSocket client for the command-line, to test your WebSocket connections.

### Install wscat:
```shell
npm install -g wscat
```

### Connect to Your WebSocket Server:
```shell
wscat -c ws://localhost:6001/app/app-key?protocol=7&client=js&version=4.3.1&flash=false
```
Replace app-key with your actual Pusher app key.

Once connected, you can subscribe to channels and listen for events.


#### After connecting, you can subscribe to a channel:
```json
{
  "event": "pusher:subscribe",
  "data": {
    "auth": "",
    "channel": "<channel>"
  }
}
```

Replace my-app-key with your actual Pusher app key.

Once connected, you can subscribe to channels and listen for events.

Listen for Events:

After subscribing, any event broadcasted on the channel will be received by wscat.


## Using Postman for WebSocket Testing

Open Postman and go to the WebSocket testing feature.  

### Connect to the WebSocket using the URL:
```shell
ws://localhost:6001/app/my-app-key?protocol=7&client=js&version=4.3.1&flash=false
```

#### Subscribe to a Channel by sending the JSON payload:
```json
{
  "event": "pusher:subscribe",
  "data": {
    "auth": "",
    "channel": "notifications.alert"
  }
}
```
